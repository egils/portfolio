# Egidijus 'Egils' Lukauskas portfolio design

This template used for my personal portfolio web. This is made public in case you need any ideas of how to something
I did with this design. 

If you consider taking this layout for your own personal web - I don't mind. Yet I may be really disappointed that 
you actually lack talent to think something of your own. Or are you just that lazy and do not care for your own 
image and lack spirit to be creative? 

Anyway, if you find this repo useful for you in any way - I'm really happy with it.
